### About this 'project'
* It's not actually that fancy project, but I always like to work with web development
* Yes, I'm totally using this as a tutorial, I'm using a lot these (severl months), and I think that I do want want to spend sometime away from data and that kinda of stuffs.
* Obviously, I shouldn't have included the *.html file, and obviously I could now remove it and save myself from this painful typing, but I won't; just for nothing. Things shouldn't have to be perfect!


### How it's working, and why the heck I should care?
Well, you don't have any reason not to care! Let's get serious guys!
It's very simply actually, you first run the entertainment_center.py, from then it basically calls a function that is basically a method of 
fresh_tomateos.py module. Which generate the *.html for you! And Violla.

There wouldn't be any issues. If you could further develop it let me see it.
